Minutes from Previous Meeting
Discussed how everything was coming together, and how to resolve merge conflicts. We actually did a pull request in the meeting to ensure everyone was on the same page
 as to policies for doing merge requests and what were the standards we were setting as to functionality and design. We discussed how Sam was running into a slight complication
  for the inventory stock functionality, but we will push that task to the next sprint. We will still be on pace to complete the project, and Sam has already worked out some functionality,
   so the task is not completely untouched.
