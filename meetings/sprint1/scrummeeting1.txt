Minutes:
Since this was our first meeting since the initial meeting, we were touching base on how things were going for each of us. We were speaking on how Next.js
 requires a bit of learning for each of us, but it seems like it will be a good choice in the long run. Each of us is having unique difficulties and challenges in our functions.
 It seems like we didn’t include enough work to do in this sprint, so we may increase the workload for the next sprint.
