We were discussing certain issues we were running into with type declarations in typescript, and how sometimes we may not use typescript files when unnecessary for the ease of use.
 Additionally, we discussed how we plan on splitting up the api endpoints to ensure we do not have redundant API endpoints and the endpoints make sense given their purpose. We discussed
  how each of us completed our tasks and some insights we gained from completing our tasks to hopefully help each other in the future.
